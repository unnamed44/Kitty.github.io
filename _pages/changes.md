Rather than having changelogs spread across several repositories, I figured it'd be much more convenient to put all changes in one spot.

Most people will be doing bulk updates when TERA gets a major patch anyway, so it matches up nicely with `tera-proxy`'s release schedule.

You can select a specific version from the navigation menu, or have a look at the [latest changes]({{ '/changes/latest/' | absolute_url }}).
